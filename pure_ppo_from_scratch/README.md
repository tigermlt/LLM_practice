# PPO from scratch
This is a toy project that implements PPO from sratch. It doesn't involve LLM, instead it uses Cart Pole in openAI gym as the environment to give next state, reward etc given an action

The Cart Pole problem can be seen [here](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/). It has 2 actions and 4 states/observations.
